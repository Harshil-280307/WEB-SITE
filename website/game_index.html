            <h3 class="topic">Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle played on a 9x9 grid, divided

                   <h4 class="cardSubHeading"> Tips & Tricks to Solve Sudoku Efficiently </h4>
               
                   <p>* Start with the Easy Numbers – Look for rows, columns, or boxes that alrea
                     dy have many numbers filled in. These are easier to complete..</p>
                   <p>* Use the “Only Choice” Rule – If a number can only go in one spot
                     within a row, column, or box, place it there immediately..</p>
                   <p>* Avoid Guessing – Sudoku is a logic-based game. If you guess,
                     you might create an error that ruins the whole puzzle.</p>

            <h3 class="topic">Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
                 One player uses X,and the other uses O. Players take turns placing 
                their marks in an empty square, aiming to be the first to get three in a row horizontally, 
                vertically, or diagonally. If the grid fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

                   <h4 class="cardSubHeading">Tips & Tricks to Win More Often: </h4>
               
                   <p>* Claim the Center First – If you start the game, placing your  mark in the center gives you
                     the best chances of winning, as it connects to the most possible winning lines.</p>
                   <p>* Block Your Opponent – Always keep an eye on your opponent’s moves and block them if 
                     they are about to complete three in a row..</p>
                   <p>* Use the Corners Strategically – If your opponent takes the center, playing in a corner
                     can create multiple chances to win.</p>
